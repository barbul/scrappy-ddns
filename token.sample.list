# This file lists valid tokens for servers/networks you want to monitor for 
# public IP address changes. Each line has the form:
#
# <token>:<name>
#
# where <token> is an alphanumeric string and `<name>` is a friendly name to 
# appear in alerts. Tokens are like passwords. They should be secret and hard
# to guess. The following web site generates nice long random alphanumeric 
# strings that make perfect tokens: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm

# EXAMPLES

# My home network
# NRmP324IsdSo2xidk69imtR2:Home network
# Branch office (VPN)
